# Python-Tower-and-Dice-Simulation
/**A short script used to simulate a random walk simulator for a python dice game**/

The code simulates a game with the following restrictions:

  1) Starting at step 50 of a tower a dice is rolled
  2) If a 1 or a 2 is rolled the player must move one step down tower
  3) If a 3, 4 or 5 is rolled the player can take a step up the tower
  4) If a 6 is rolled the dice the player can take the amount of steps of a new roll up the tower

/** The following python code was used to simulate this random walk scenario where the chance of winning the game was calcuated **/
